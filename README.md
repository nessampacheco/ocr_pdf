Digitizing Historical Documents with Simple OCR with Tesseract

The notebook in this repositoty shows a simple approach to extracting text from PDF files using Tesseract OCR. This process is called OCR, that stands for Optical Character Recognition.

I believe historians can greatly benefit from Python for accessing content in PDFs; because it can transform PDFs based-images into searchable text and improve text get from searchable PDFs.

All historians will understand that this tasks facilitate when doing a first exploratory analysis of the text, looking for specific concepts or just quoting. This way, Python can be a valuable tool for historians.

For this demonstration, I chose documents that are likely to be accessible to historians researching in digital repositories. This is the first article from a series with more two parts. In this opportunity, let’s focus on a simple case. From here, we will be able to progress to more advanced parts (part-II, part-III -soon).

For these purposes, I selected a PDF with Good Quality Text: what offers a good quality text extraction. The example used The example used here is “Diario Politico” by Jose Victorino Lastarria[1].
